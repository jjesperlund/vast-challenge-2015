You have access to movement tracking information for all of the paying park visitors over the three days of the Scott Jones celebration. 
This data contains many patterns that are useful for planning park operations. On this particular weekend a crime occurred and the data likely contains information pertinent to that crime.

Use visual analytics to analyze the available data and develop responses to the questions below. 
In addition, prepare a video that shows how you used visual analytics to solve this challenge. We encourage novel visual representations and analytic approaches!

If you choose to do so, you may use information from both mini-challenge 1 and mini-challenge 2 to develop your answer. However, you will not be penalized for using the movement data only. Reviewers will take into account which data you used and evaluate your submissions based on that data only.
